                        Korean high school and college students who are interested in programming have difficulties in finding the right resources in Korean.

                    <p className='text'>
                        Currently, the most common way to learn to code in Korea is by studying on your own through books or hagwons, a for-profit academy. 
                        However, many of the resources are in English and Hagwons are mostly located in Seoul, South Korea. 
                    </p>
                    <p className='text'>
                        So students who are not proficient in English or do not have access to hagwons have difficulty in studying programming and understanding how it works.

                    <p className='text'> 
                        The best way to learn anything is by trying it out yourself. In coders, we want students to dive right into creating the project. 
                        We are bringing the coding experience to the mobile app through interactive activities. So students will be able to learn as they create the project that they would like to make through <span className='bold'>bite-sized learning</span> in their spare time. 
                        With coders, we want to provide a different direction for studying coding in Korea. Rather being boring or pressuring, we want to help students understand and enjoy coding.

                        In the app, users will be able to select a project they would like to create from the homepage. For each project, they are divided into different sections,

                        Then users will solve sets of interactive quizzes to code the project. <br />

                        For the look and feel of the app, I wanted it to friendly and fun to lift the pressure and fear of studying code. 
                        So I chose a rounded typeface that worked in both Korean and English and added illustrations to add a friendly character to the app. 
                        While I wanted the app to feel friendly I didn't want it to be too childish as this app is targeted towards high school and college students. 
                        So the overall design of the app is kept simple.
